# Puzzle game

## Scope

The scope of this project was to create a small scale text based puzzle game that is to be completed in no more than 120 seconds within a 48 hour time limit.

### Story

You have escaped from the hospital and for some reason have been drawn to a certain house. It feels both familair and foreign, the feeling of both being here while having no memory feels like a sueral case of deja-vue with a horrible case of anxiety.
You must attempt to slove the puzzles of the house to solve the mystery.

### tools used

The game is developed fully using Java and built in java libraries. We made use of JDK version 8.1 to create our game along with the Swing/AWT GUI tool kit for our user interface.
